## Verification Notes
The nachzehrer is a folkloric belief from German tradition with no evidence of supernatural activity. Historical "nachzehrer" cases represent:
1. Natural decomposition processes misunderstood
2. Plague and disease transmission interpreted through supernatural framework
3. Cultural mechanisms for dealing with epidemic death
4. Pre-scientific attempts to explain contagion

Physical evidence from archaeological excavations shows burial practices intended to prevent nachzehrer, confirming the belief's historical prevalence. However, all "vampire" signs have natural explanations related to decomposition, disease, and environment.

**Research Guidelines**: Approach nachzehrer as a cultural and historical phenomenon rather than a potentially real creature. Focus on what the belief reveals about pre-modern understanding of disease, death, and community responses to epidemic. The nachzehrer is valuable for understanding historical worldviews, evolution of medical knowledge, and the role of folklore in making sense of mortality and contagion.
